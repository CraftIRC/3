#### CraftIRC 3 configuration file ####
#######################################

# Welcome, new user! Please read carefully:

# CraftIRC is a very powerful and flexible tool for all your communication needs. Being fully customizable, it TAKES SOME TIME TO SET UP.
# Please set aside half an hour to READ THIS FILE CAREFULLY and configure everything according to your needs. If you don't, CraftIRC
#   will NOT WORK PROPERLY.
# The CraftIRC developers can be found on #craftirc in irc.esper.net . Read the topic on arrival. If you have a specific issue you need
#   help with and we are around, we will help. BUT WE WILL NOT SET UP CRAFTIRC FOR YOU. If you don't want to/can't do this yourself, try
#   asking a friend or maybe if you're really lucky a user in #craftirc is feeling generous ;)

# Recommendations: http://instantyaml.appspot.com/ (the output doesn't matter, just see if there are errors) ; save as UTF-8 ; use a text
#   editor with YAML syntax highlighting to make the file more readable.

    #### IRC FORMATTING: %b% %u% %r% %o% %k% %kNUM% (NUM is 0 to 15); Do the same as CTRL+key in mIRC (%o% uses'foreground')

  #  filters:
  #    #Each filter contains regular expressions for formatting variables. This one ignores commands (.TEXT)
  #    - message: '^\.[^ ]+'
  #
  #  #Every path can override the formatting strings defined in settings.formatting .

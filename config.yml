#### CraftIRC 3 configuration file ####
#######################################

# Welcome, new user! Please read carefully:

# CraftIRC is a very powerful and flexible tool for all your communication needs. Being fully customizable, it TAKES SOME TIME TO SET UP.
# Please set aside half an hour to READ THIS FILE CAREFULLY and configure everything according to your needs.

# If you don't follow these instructions, CraftIRC will NOT WORK PROPERLY! Pay special attention to sections marked as [CHANGES REQUIRED]

# The CraftIRC developers can be found on #craftirc in irc.esper.net . Read the topic on arrival. If you have a specific issue you need
#   help with and we are around, we will help. BUT WE WILL NOT SET UP CRAFTIRC FOR YOU. If you don't want to/can't do this yourself, try
#   asking a friend or maybe if you're really lucky a user in #craftirc is feeling generous ;)

# Recommendations: http://instantyaml.appspot.com/ (the output doesn't matter, just see if there are errors) ; save as UTF-8 ; use a text
#   editor with YAML syntax highlighting to make the file more readable.

# ******************* MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS *******************

  cancelled-tag: ''           #Cancelled chat is sent here. Give this tag a name to handle messages cancelled by a chat plugin.
  console-tag: 'console'      #The minecraft server console. Handles /say and .cmd.

  auto-paths: true
  
  # If set, this character will be inserted after each character ("abc" -> "a_b_c_") to prevent IRC highlights

# ******************* COMMUNICATION PATHS *******************
# (For most uses, only needed if settings.auto-paths is false. Skip this section otherwise.)
# Declare here a path for every pair of endpoints between which you want messages to flow.
# For each path you can filter the messages sent by event type or contents.
# Paths are one-way, so you must declare A to B and B to A if you want a two-way channel.
paths:

  #- source: 'minecraft'
  #  target: 'changeme'
    
  #- source: 'changeme'     # These are endpoint tags
  #  target: 'minecraft'    #
  #  
  #  #Every path can contain a list of filters that block any matched messages.
  #  #To replace instead of blocking, see the replacement filters section below.
  #  filters:
  #    #Each filter contains regular expressions for formatting variables. This one ignores commands (.TEXT)
  #    - message: '^\.[^ ]+'
  #    #Slightly more advanced example, ignores specific messages from a specific user.
  #    - sender: '^Lain.*$'
  #      message: "\x0312Automsg\x0304"
  #
  #  #Every path can override the formatting strings defined in settings.formatting .
  #  formatting:
  #  #  chat: '[%srcChannel%] <%sender%> %message%'

  #  #Every path can override the attributes block from default-attributes (see below).

  #  #A path can inherit missing attributes from another existing path rather than from default-attributes.

# ******************* REPLACEMENT FILTERS *******************
# This section allows you to set up find and replace rules on
# every section of every message sent by CraftIRC.

# If you want to delete messages instead you should use the path filters, above.

# Each filter contains regular expressions for formatting variables.

# For example, you can change the prefix of IRC Channel Operators to something 
# different by executing a replacement on the %ircPrefix% variable.

# filters:
#   ircPrefix: ['@' : 'Op ']

# Or you could censor IP addresses to and from chat.

# filters:
#   message: ['(\d+\.){3}\d+' : '#.#.#.#']

# When writing searches, the following characters have special meanings:
# ^ $ . + ? * { } [ ] ( )
# If you want to use these characters normally, escape them with a backslash \.
# When writing the replacement, make sure you escape any $ or \ characters
# with an additional \ unless you want to use backreferences.

# Example: Changing emoticon ^_^ to $_$
 
# filters:
#   message: ['\^_\^' : '\$_\$']

# To delete a search, use an empty replacement, or none at all.

# This example shows two ways of deleting. The searches are xxx and yyy.

# filters:
#   message: [xxx, yyy : '']

# Remember that any list can be written in two ways.
# filters:
#   prefix: ['mod' : 'Mod', 'adm' : 'Admin']

# is equivalent to

# filters:
#   prefix:
#   - 'mod' : 'Mod'
#   - 'adm' : 'Admin'
